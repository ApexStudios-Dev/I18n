# ApexStudios - Localization
Public repo which holds all translation data for our projects.

Each folder in this Repository holds translation files (`.json`) for one of our mods.<br>
Each translation file holds translation entries the respective language.

To add support for a new language create a translation file for the language you wish to add support for and provide translation values inside of it.<br>
[See here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Language) for full list of languages Minecraft Natively supports.

Pull requests attempting to modify the **en_us** or **en_gb** language files **WILL BE** rejected as they are protected & auto-generated.
These files are provided as an example of what other languages should attempt to translate to.

If you believe an English translation is incorrect, [join our Discord](https://discord.apexstudios.xyz/) and notify us via the `#issues` forum-channel.
